# Capstone Project: Environmental and Socioeconomic Factors Impacting Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) in California

This project investigates the relationship between environmental exposures, social vulnerabilities, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevalence across communities in California.

Using the **CalEnviroScreen 4.0** dataset, which compiles detailed metrics at the census-tract level, the analysis explores how factors such as air quality (e.g., PM2.5, ozone), pollution exposure (e.g., diesel particulate matter, toxic releases), and demographic pressures (e.g., poverty, housing burden, linguistic isolation) contribute to disparities in cardiovascular health outcomes.

## Data Source

ðŸ“‚ **CalEnviroScreen 4.0 (OEHHA, California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment)**  
- Link: [https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen-40](https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen-40)  
- Over 80 environmental, health, and demographic variables for 8,000+ census tracts in California.  
- Includes:
  - Environmental indicators: ozone, PM2.5, diesel particulate matter, toxic releases.
  - Population health data: asthma rates, low birth weight, cardiovascular disease.
  - Demographic factors: poverty, educational attainment, housing burden, linguistic isolation.

## Project Goals

- Understand the **spatial and statistical patterns of cardiovascular disease** across California.  
- Identify **environmental and socioeconomic factors most strongly correlated with CVD rates**.  
- Build a **baseline regression model to predict CVD risk** based on these factors.  
- Inform **public health and environmental justice efforts** by identifying high-risk communities.

## Summary of Findings

- The optimized polynomial Ridge regression model (degree 2) with best alpha = 100 demonstrates strong predictive performance:
  - Cross-validated RMSE: 3.697  
  - Test RMSE: 3.760  
  - Test RÂ²: 0.43, indicating that the model explains 43% of the variance in cardiovascular disease rates.
- **Education** is the most influential predictor, exhibiting both strong linear and nonlinear effects (notably EducationÂ²).
- Other important contributors include **Poverty, Ozone levels, Linguistic Isolation,** and **Unemployment**, highlighting the combined impact of social vulnerabilities and environmental exposures.
- Significant interaction terms such as **PM2.5 Ã— Groundwater Threats**, **Diesel PM Ã— Poverty**, and **PM2.5 Ã— Traffic** reveal multifactorial influences on cardiovascular disease risk.
- Negative coefficients for some interactions suggest complex relationships where certain exposure combinations may mitigate or modulate risk.
- The modelâ€™s use of nonlinear and interaction features confirms the multifaceted and nonlinear determinants underlying cardiovascular disease rates.
